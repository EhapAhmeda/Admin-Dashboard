# Modern Admin Dashboard

Proud to Share My Project!   

I’ve developed a **Modern Admin Dashboard** focused on **functionality, responsiveness, and user experience**.  
From the moment you log in, every feature is designed to make management smoother, faster, and more engaging.

# Overview
The project begins at the **Login Page**, where validation ensures only authorized users can access the system.  
Once logged in, the **Dashboard Overview** provides **live counters** for **Users, Posts, Comments, and Favorites**, giving a quick snapshot of the system.  

From there, each module is fully interactive:

- **Users Management** – edit user details, mark favorites, or remove them dynamically.  
- **Comments Management** – edit and update comments directly inside the table.  
- **Posts Management** – make instant edits or updates without leaving the dashboard.  
- **Favorites System** – view and manage all favorites in one centralized place.
